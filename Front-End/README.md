# Bus Reservation

## Description 

In order to implement the Secure Session Management tactic we designed a simple bus reservation system in which we created three user roles with different level of access for the content of the website.

## Roles: 
1. **Guest** : 
   A guest has only access to the reservation page where he can see the availability of buses but cannot book a reservation.
2. **Regular user** : 
   A Regular can view the avaibilty of buses and book a reservation.
3. **Admin** : A admin can see the list of user  created
